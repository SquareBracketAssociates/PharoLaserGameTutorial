! Introduction

This book is an adaptation for Pharo of a tutorial originally written by Stephan Wessels for Squeak in 2007, which is available at *http://squeak.preeminent.org/tut2007/*. 

Stéphane Ducasse adapted this tutorial to Pharo (3.0). Here is a list of changes:
- Added Pharo installation instructions (see appendix)  
- The flow of the tutorial has been adapted from place to place.
- New material and more explanation has been added such as design discussions, use of refactorings...
- Less screenshots have been used to avoid the obsolescence when the IDE will change.
- All the sample code has been typed and shown in the text because different document output formats may place pictures in different positions. 
- Figures are now cross referenced.
- Topics on package management and coding in the debugger have been added.
- All the code has been adapted to Pharo and is available from SmalltalkHub (*http://smalltalkhub.com*) in the LaserGame project under StephaneDucasse's account ( *http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~StephaneDucasse/LaserGame*).

Many tutorials showcase just the technology, by presenting the shortest (unrealistic) development path to the final product. This tutorial takes another path, documenting the warts and all development of a project from first concept through to deployment. Each step is described in detail, including (especially) when mistakes were made.

The aim here is to show how natural it is to start from a rough concept, then iterate over the design, refactoring the implementation with the confidence that comes from test-driven development. This tutorial demonstrates not only how to program Pharo, but an effective way to evolve an application over time, which provides Pharo its agility for fast application development.

Stéphane really wants to thank Steven Wessels for his gift to the Pharo and Smalltalk community.

!! Conventions used in this book

A large part of this tutorial provides code samples and discussions about these samples. Within the narrative, references to a class name and method name will look like ==MyClass== and ==myMethod== respectively. Blocks of sample code are shown as follows:

[[[
MyClass>>myMethod
  ^ 1 + 2.
]]]

@@note You should not type the ==MyClass>>== part. The ==MyClass>>== prefix is a convention that specifies which class a method belongs to. The specified class must be selected in the System Browser when the method code is entered. When entered, it will look like this:

[[[
myMethod
  ^ 1 + 2.
]]]

The caret ==^== is the return symbol, here indicating a value of ==3== is returned by the method.
