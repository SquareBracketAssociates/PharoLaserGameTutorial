			I decided to modify the background color of my World.

			we are developing (at least until we put borders around it);
			Second, I wanted a little visual variety.

			This page describes an optional step.  It is not necessary for the
			development of our game.  If you would rather, you can skip to the next page.

			gradient using the "appearance" sub-menu of the World menu.

			I keep the Test Runner around, just minimized.
			You can also see the convenient workspace I'm using
			to open new instances of the LaserGame morph.  My
			Squeak window is much wider than the image shown here.
			Like they say on TV Movies, "This program has been
			modified for format and content".
