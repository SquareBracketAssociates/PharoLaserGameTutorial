		<h3>Next Steps Towards Deployment</h3>
		<p>
			We have some hooks in place that provide a way to have our Laser Game morph
			be the visible morph in the Squeak world.  And the existing code handles
			correct centering when someone re-sizes the main Squeak window.  We can probably
			tighten all of that up but let's push onwards closer to a stand-alone Laser Game application.
		</p>
		<p>
			The concept here is that we will continue to develop with the existing Squeak image
			and also make a new second Squeak image for the deployed application.  There will then be two Squeak
			images as far as our Laser Game development efforts is concerned.  And they should behave differently.
			The development image will be exactly as we have been operating so far and the deployed image will always
			launch with our game running in "full world" mode.  Also, we want to do everything we can to disable
			user access to the regular Squeak menus and other development facilities when running the deployed image.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's begin by changing a few methods on our LaserGame class.  I want to modify the
			#fullWorld: class method.  It's not a "code" change.  I just want to change the comment
			to set the value to "true" instead.  This seems like a more helpful setup.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			<b>fullWorld: aBoolean</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"LaserGame fullWorld: false"<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FullWorld := aBoolean
		</p>
		<p>
			Next we will add two new class methods to LaserGame.  These "worker" methods
			are useful for launching the game in either the full world or standard mode.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			<b>launchStandard</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"LaserGame launchStandard"<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| morph |<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self fullWorld: false.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;morph := self new.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;morph openInHand.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^morph
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			<b>launchFullWorld</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"LaserGame launchFullWorld"<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| morph |<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self fullWorld: true.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;morph := self new.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;morph openInWorld.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^morph
		</p>
		<p>
			When we attempt to restrict the user's access to standard Squeak actions
			that should include disabling the Command-. (Command Period) capability.
			Currently, when a user performs a Command-. Squeak will drop into the debugger.
			This is obviously something we will curtail.
		</p>
		<p>
			As it turns out, there's a Preference we can set in our progamming
			that enables and disables this capability.  We will design things so that the
			launched application will have this feature disabled.  That means we can
			detect the presence of the feature being disabled or not to know if we are
			running a development mode.
		</p>
		<p>
			Add the following instance method to LaserGame.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			<b>quitGameExitSqueakCheck</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Use the Preferences cmdDotEnabled as an indicator that we are run-time or not."<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preferences cmdDotEnabled ifFalse: [Smalltalk quitPrimitive]
		</p>
		<p>
			When this method is called if we detect that command-dot is disabled, we assume we are not
			in the developer image.  You'll see how we use this next.
			Add another new instance method to LaserGame.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			<b>quitGameAction</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self delete.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self class fullWorld ifTrue: [self class fullWorld: false].<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self quitGameExitSqueakCheck
		</p>
		<p>
			When we call this method we are expecting to perform a game quit action.  We delete/close the morph
			and then if we find we are in full world mode we turn that off.  That's just a handy thing we will use as we
			develop.  Most importantly we then call the #quitGameExitSqueakCheck
			method which we already saw would cause Squeak to exit if this is the non-development
			image.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now we modify the existing #xxx LaserGame instance method to utilize this sequence.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			<b>quitGame</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(self confirm: 'Are you sure you want to quit?') ifTrue: [self quitGameAction]
		</p>
		<p>
			The way we have this designed, unless we disable command-. in our development image, the Quit action of
			our game will act essentially as it always is.  It will have the additional behavior of exiting
			Squeak if this is the deployed image.
