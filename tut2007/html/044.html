			We have some kind of behavior that tells us the code goes into
			a loop but examination so far shows everything looks good.  However,
			it is suprising we are only on the first cell encountered by
			the laser beam.  Perhaps that's also a good clue.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's drop into the code and single-step our way
			through this algorithm with the debugger.
			Doing this step-by-step in this tutorial will seem
			a bit tedious but we should not need to endure much longer before
			we find our elusive bug.

		<p>
			Click "restart" in the debugger.  Press the "over" button in
			the debugger a few times until we get to this condition of
			execution.

			If we examine the instance variables for "loc", "dirSym",
			"direction", "vector", "newLoc" and "nextCell",
			everything looks correct.  We expect the next cell to be
			at location 2@5 and that it's a blank cell.
			Our dirSym value (the direction our laser is now traveling)
			looks correct.
		</p>
		<p>
			Okay, it looks like our next step of execution will
			create a new LaserPathElement object.  Single-step with the
			debugger using the "over" button until we're about to create
			the new object.
