		<h3>The Smalltalk-Way To Do A Case Statement</h3>
		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>
			While working on the previous section of code a very useful design concept
			may have gone unnoticed.  If you've been creating Object Oriented designs for
			a while you may already be doing this sort of thing.  But since this is a
			tutorial,
			I want to go back and review why we did something the way we
			did.
		</p>
		<h4>Traditional Approach</h4>
		<p>
			There was a place in the code where we had to be able to decide which
			direction symbol
			to use for an adjacent cell.  In a traditional programming style we could
			have
			expressed this as:
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			Cell>>adjacentInversionSymbolToUseFor: ourDirectionSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ourDirectionSymbol = #east ifTrue: [^#west].<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ourDirectionSymbol = #north ifTrue: [^#south].<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ourDirectionSymbol = #west ifTrue: [^#east].<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ourDirectionSymbol = #south ifTrue: [^#north].<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			You may recognize this code as a <i>"switch"</i> or <i>"case"</i> statement.  I've even
			seen
			a Smalltalk developer once "enhance" his development environment by
			providing
			a "case" statement.
		</p>
		<h4>Applying A Class Hierarchy</h4>
		<p>
			There's another approach.  We created a hierarchy of classes that
			represented the
			four directions.  These classes will continue to be used and extended, based
			upon
			what we have done so far.  The hierarchy was written to look like this:
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			Object<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GridDirection<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GridDirectionEast<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GridDirectionNorth<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GridDirectionSouth<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GridDirectionWest<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			When we used this hierarchy we did something like this:
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			Cell>>adjacentInversionSymbolToUseFor: ourDirectionSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| direction |<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;direction := GridDirection directionFor: ourDirectionSymbol.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^direction adjacentInversionSymbol<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			We could have even written something more direct like:
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			Cell>>adjacentInversionSymbolToUseFor: ourDirectionSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^GridDirection adjacentInversionSymbol: ourDirectionSymbol<br>
		</p>
		<h4>How Does It Work?</h4>
		<p>
			So how did that work?  We have a common abstract class to handle the
			queries
			that would select one of the directions for us.  The first thing we
			did was assign a class method to each of the direction subclasses that
			answered their unique direction symbol.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			GridDirectionEast class>>directionSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^#east<br>
			<br>
			GridDirectionNorth class>>directionSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^#north<br>
			<br>
			GridDirectionSouth class>>directionSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^#south<br>
			<br>
			GridDirectionWest class>>directionSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^#west<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Then we added a class method that made it easy to find the correct
			direction class.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			GridDirection class>>directionFor: aSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^self subclasses detect: [:cls | cls directionSymbol = aSymbol]<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now if each of the subclasses responds to the polymorphic request
			#adjacentInversionSymbol...
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			GridDirectionEast class>>adjacentInversionSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^#west<br>
			<br>
			GridDirectionNorth class>>adjacentInversionSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^#south<br>
			<br>
			GridDirectionSouth class>>adjacentInversionSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^#north<br>
			<br>
			GridDirectionWest class>>adjacentInversionSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^#east<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			We could have added a single class method on GridDirection to do the
			direct operation.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			GridDirection class>>adjacentInversionSymbol: aSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^(self directionFor: aSymbol) adjacentInversionSymbol<br>
		</p>
		<h4>Handling Default And Unmatched</h4>
		<p>
			What about the default or unmatched case that you often see in a switch
			statement?
			The unmatched case could be handled by GridDirection.
			Now we enhance the #directionFor: code.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			GridDirection class>>directionFor: aSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^self subclasses detect: [:cls | cls directionSymbol = aSymbol]
			ifNone: [self]<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			This way if no one has a matching direction symbol (maybe we were sent #foo
			as a direction to check)
			the GridDirection itself will get the request.  Then we write whatever
			default behavior
			we want.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			GridDirection class>>adjacentInversionSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^#noneYouIdiot<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			And for the default case?  That's easy too.  Again you could just let
			GridDirection answer
			for anyone if they didn't have an answer of their own.  For example, maybe
			only north,
			south should have their own unique answers.  Everyone else maybe should
			default to #east.
		</p>
		<p>
			Delete the #adjacentInversionSymbol class methods from GridDirectionEast
			and GridDirectionWest.
			Then provide a default answer on GridDirection.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			GridDirection class>>adjacentInversionSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^#north<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			If you want both unmatched and defaults, add a class to handle one of them.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			Object<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GridDirection<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GridDirectionEast<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GridDirectionNorth<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GridDirectionSouth<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GridDirectionWest<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GridDirectionUnmatched<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Change the #directionFor: code again.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			GridDirection class>>directionFor: aSymbol<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^self subclasses detect: [:cls | cls directionSymbol = aSymbol]
			ifNone: [GridDirectionUnmatched]<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Now you can implement special behavior for unmatched answers and/or let
			them fall back up to GridDirection
			for a default if you want.
		</p>
		<h4>Back To The Tutorial</h4>
		<p>
			Okay, I just wanted to take a break here and share a bit about
			how we used classes to handle (and avoid) a bunch of ifTrue/ifFalse situations.
			Back to our project...
