			Close the Snapshot Browser.  Let's go back an examine the Monticello browser.
			I resized it to be wider.  We want to save our package definition in a
			repository.  Since this is the first time we are doing this we will go through the
			steps of creating a repository as a folder on our hard drive.  This folder will
			contain all versions of the Laser Game package we intend to save.
		</p>

		<p>
			Before we add the definition of the new repository to Monticello we need to have
			the physical folder.  I'll create a new folder called "Projects".  In there I will
			save any Monticello project I create.  It will be the repository folder.
		</p>
		<img src="images/651.jpg">
		<p>
			Back inside Squeak we can click on the "+Repository" button.
			It will pop up a menu asking us to choose the type of repository.
			For this tutorial work I will choose "directory".
		</p>
		<img src="images/652.jpg">
		<p>
			Squeak presents a dialog window for us to select the directory we intend to
			use for our repository.
		</p>
		<img src="images/653.jpg">
		<p>
			After you complete this step you will see our new repository definition in the list
			of available repositories for our Laser Game package.  The other repository
			in the list is the default one created for all Monticello packages.
			You may have noticed that there were quite a few interesting choices in the pop-up
			menu for repository type.  I often use FTP when I want to publish my code to
			an FTP server and then share it with other developers working on the same projects.
		</p>
		<img src="images/654.jpg">
		<p>
			With the repository selected, we should now click the "Save" button.
			Monticello pop open a window for us to edit version information about our package.
			By default it assigned the package-version name "Laser-Game-sbw.1".  Monticello figured
			out my developer initials from Squeak and assigned the number "1" as the first version
			number.
		</p>
		<img src="images/655.jpg">
		<p>
			You can also type a comment about the package before you press "Accept".
		</p>
		<img src="images/656.jpg">
		<p>
			Monticello takes a snapshot of the code included in the package to be
			versioned and writes it to the repository.  A confirmation window is
			presented.  Also, you can see that our package now shows the current
			version number in the packages list.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can close both of these windows.
			Later we will show how you can load or review a previously saved
			version of your package.
		</p>
		<p class="note">
			The basic LaserGame is complete and can be used within the Squeak environment.
			The following sections of this tutorial all add enhancements and features
			to this base we have just created.
