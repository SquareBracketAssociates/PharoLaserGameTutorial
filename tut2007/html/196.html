					We think we have removed the brittleness from our unit tests so that
					we are no longer sensitive to changes to the general dimensions
					of our cells.
					So here's the real test if this is true.
					We should change the cell size yet again.
					By doing a combination of running all the unit
					tests and actually opening a new LaserGame morph with the even larger cells
					and then playing with it, will tell us that we have these
					cell size sensitivity changes resolved.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					Before we change the size of our cells, we should close any
					open LaserGame morphs.  Changing the definition of the cells while
					existing LaserGame morphs are potentially trying to update their graphics
					could cause problems.
					Make sure any existing Laser Games are closed.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here's the modification to the #cellExtent class method
					on CellRenderer that will make the cells larger.
				</p>
				<p class="code">
					<b>cellExtent</b><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^50@50
				</p>
				<p>
					Re-run all our unit tests.  Everything passes.
					Let's open up a new LaserGame morph.  I had to adjust the open
					position because the cells are larger now and consequently so is
					the board.  Here's my modified Workspace code for opening the
					LaserGame morph.
				</p>
				<p class="code">
					(LaserGame randomizedGridOfExtent: 8@10)<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position: 20@230;<br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;openInWorld
				</p>
				<p>
					It works great.
