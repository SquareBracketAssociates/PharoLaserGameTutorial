			Run your workspace code again.  Here's a slightly scaled-down picture of
			how it looks in my Squeak development image.

			The cool thing is that when you resize your Squeak desktop, the Laser Game morph
			"notices" and re-centers itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Quit the Laser Game morph via its Quit button.  I changed the Workspace code back
			to running without Full World mode.

			I  then re-launched Laser Game to ensure it worked fine
			the "normal" way.
			I also changed the desktop color, via the appearances menu, to a solid non-blue color.
			My thoughts here are that I'll let the gradient blue desktop be my visual clue as to
			when I'm working while the Full World is on.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can see where we are headed.  When we make a deployed version of our Squeak development
			image, we'll set the Full World mode and then make sure that various tools and menu buttons
			are disabled.  That's still work to come.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is a good breaking point.  You can verify that unit tests still run and save the Monitcello
			package for Laser-Game as verison 21.
