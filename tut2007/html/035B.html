				<h3>Leaving Notes In Your Code</h3>
				<p>
					You will probably run into the need to remember important
					issues to go back and revisit later.
					What's a good way to make it easy to leave little notes to
					yourself in the code?
				</p>
				<img src="images/432.jpg">
				<p>
					If we implement an instance method #revisit: on Object a handy technique
					is revealed for collecting all your notes.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is an important detail here I need to discuss.
					The #revisit: method was added to the Object class using a new
					protocol called "*Laser-Game-Model".
					Why did we do that?
					This new #revisit: method is an "extension" to a base class in Squeak.
					It's part of our new project but we need to be able to find it when
					we search for code belonging to our project.  Obviously, the class
					Object already exists in Squeak so we cannot add Object to our
					Laser-Game-Model system category.  And we wouldn't want to do that anyway
					since only this one method is of interest to us, as far as enhancing the
					base code is concerned.
				</p>
				<p class="note">
					To be completely clear here, find the class Object and on the instance side add a new
					method protocol named "*Laser-Game-Model".  Then add the #revisit: method as shown on
					that protocol.
				</p>
				<p>
					So we created a unique protocol and then added the #revisit: method
					on that protocol.  Later, when we learn about our source control tool,
					Monticello, you will see the real reason we chose this unusual name
					for a protocol.
				</p>
				<p>
					So how do we use this?
					Go back to the Grid class.
				</p>
				<img src="images/433.jpg">
				<p>
					The #revisit: method doesn't do anything.  But we can pass a String argument and
					so we leave ourselves a little note.  As a convention I usually put my initials
					and the date when I created the note in my text.
				</p>
				<p>
					Adding the same revisit to the #at:put: method makes sense too.
				</p>
				<img src="images/434.jpg">
				<p>
					Later in our development we can perform a simple search for all
					senders of #revisit: to see the places where we left "notes"
					to ourselves.
