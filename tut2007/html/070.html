			Back to our LaserGame morph.  We were working on changing
			the "Fire" button label to be set dynamically
			with the state of the laser beam in the grid.
		</p>
		<p>
			We should change the method that answers the laser's state to
			actually use the grid now.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here's a method that will answer the correct button label.
		</p>

		<p>
			The corresponding change to use the label when we create
			the button.
		</p>

		<p>
			Next, we need to enhance our #fireLaser method.  This method
			is called whenever someone clicks on our "Fire" button.
			There's a design choice we can make here.  On one hand we
			can change the button itself to send the proper message
			whenever it is clicked - like we already do for the label,
			or we could change this #fireLaser method to handle both cases.
		</p>
		<p>
			We may go back and change the button on-the-fly, but for now
			this will work fine.
		</p>
		<img src="images/300.jpg">
		<p>
			When the button will be clicked we will cause the model
			to activate or stop the laser.  But our drawing
			does know anything has happened.  We need a little more
			code.

			Let's open up a new LaserGame morph and see how it works now.
