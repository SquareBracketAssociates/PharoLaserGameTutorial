				<h3>Making a Deeper Grid Unit Test</h3>
				<p>
					With the basics on the cells working,
					and a minimal test for Grid, we can start
					to write a much deeper unit test for the
					Grid class, using broader parts of the
					overall design.  Remember the original
					diagram used to introduce the game idea?
					Let's use that for our unit test.
					Here's the empty diagram and the diagram with the
					laser firing.
				</p>
				<p>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<td>
								<img src="images/020.jpg">
							</td>
							<td>

							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</p>
				<p>
					We will need a 5x5 grid.  The blank tiles will
					already be in the grid when it's instantiated,
					so we only need to place the Target Cell and
					Mirror Cells.  To make the test case easier to read,
					I'll write an instance method to generate the ready-to-use
					Grid.  Note that this new method is on the "private" protocol.
				</p>

				<p>
					While writing the generator method I found myself
					getting confused about which part of the x@y notation to use
					for rows and columns.  That's a tip-off that we should rewrite
					some of our methods to make this task easier.
					Maybe we should have written this test before we even wrote the
					#at: and #at:put: methods on Grid?
				</p>
				<p>
					We'll have to remember to go back and fix these names to
					be more intention revealing.
