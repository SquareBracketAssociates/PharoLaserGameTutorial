			Back to the CellClickRegionTestCase class.  Enhance the unit test  to try a point
			that should not be within the ignore region.

			The inside region claimed the point 13@13.

		<p>
			That doesn't seem correct, however the test right before this one checked
			the point 5@5 and that <i>was</i> found to be in the outside click region.
			Maybe our test case is wrong?
		</p>
		<p>
			We could write a little workspace code piece that helps us
			to see exactly where the transition points are for the three click
			regions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Open up the Transcript window from the World menu and then run
			the code in this workspace.
		</p>
		<img src="images/349.jpg">
		<p>
			Earlier we had defined the extent of a cell to be 30@30 and the extent
			of the inside click region to be 14@14.
			That would make the distance from the outside of the cell until
			we get to the inside region to be somewhere around:<br>
			(30 - 14) = 16<br>
			16 / 2 = 8<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			So actually, 8 pixels is correct.  We may have made that inside extent too big.
			Let's tighten up the extent on the inside region.  The method for
			#insideRegionExtent on the CellRenderer class should be changed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Clear the contents of the Transcript and run that workspace code again.
		</p>
		<img src="images/351.jpg">
		<p>
			Modify the unit test and rerun.
		</p>
		<img src="images/352.jpg">
		<p>
			Everything passes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Write the test for the inside region.
		</p>
<!-- Thanks to Thierry Lalinne for noticing I had the wrong picture of source code here.  -->

		<p>
			Everything still passes.
			We should proceed.  We can resume
			coding with confidence because we believe
			we have written unit tests with sufficient
			coverage of our methods and because they all pass.
