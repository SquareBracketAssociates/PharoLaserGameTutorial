			It's time to draw the hint forms for when the user wants to
			rotate a mirror cell.  We'll need arrows with arcs.
			Once again we'll use a workspace for experimenting
			with drawing our forms.  The goal will be to draw
			this:
		</p>

		<p>
			In a workspace we'll create this arrow one step at a time.
			We begin with a larger final output form because of the arc.
			And we'll tighten up the arrow dimensions but similar to
			how we drew the south arrows before.  Note that we don't want much of
			any "stem" on our arrow.
		</p>
		<img src="images/463.jpg">
		<p>
			Here's our new arrow.
		</p>

			The Arc class draws arcs by quadrant.  Not as nice as we would like but
			we can make this work.  Here's the code for the first part of our
			outside arc.
		</p>
		<img src="images/465.jpg">
		<p>
			And the drawing.
		</p>
		<img src="images/466.jpg">
		<p>
			Let's draw the rest of the outside arc and the inside arc pieces.
		</p>
		<img src="images/467.jpg">
		<p>
			And the drawing.  Notice that we are clipped on the right side because
			of the size of our output form.  That's not an issue.  The final form
			will have even less of a complete arc on the right half.
		</p>
		<img src="images/468.jpg">
		<p>
			Let's draw a line that cuts the arc off.
		</p>
		<img src="images/469.jpg">
		<p>
			Here's how it turned out.
		</p>
		<img src="images/470.jpg">
		<p>
			Now that our arc is enclosed we can fill it in.
		</p>
		<img src="images/471.jpg"><br>
		<img src="images/472.jpg">
		<p>
			Okay.  We don't need the line anymore, it was there to close off the arc so
			we could fill in the black area.  The easiest way to erase the line
			is to draw over it with a white line.  However if we make the line
			<i>really wide</i> it will erase the remaining arc segments too.
		</p>
		<img src="images/473.jpg">
		<p>
			And there's our curved arrow.
		</p>
		<img src="images/474.jpg">
		<p>
			That's the counter-clockwise arrow.  It might be a simple matter to make a
			clockwise one.  All we have to do is add a step to flip the final form.
