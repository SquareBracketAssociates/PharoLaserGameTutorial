					If we were to do the same thing for our mouse-up event, the LaserGame morph would determine
					which renderer should have the request.  That renderer determines which click region handles the request
					and then the actual mouse event activity is resolved.
				</p>
				<p>
					We begin by writing a new mouse-up handling method on our LaserGame class.
				</p>
				<img src="images/555.jpg">
				<p>
					The method #mouseUpWithinBoardOffset: has not been defined yet.
				</p>
				<p>
					Modify the #mouseUp:forMorph: method to use this instead of logging diagnostics.
				</p>
				<img src="images/556.jpg">
				<p>
					Obviously our renderer hierarchy needs to handle the #mouseUpWithinBoardOffset: method send.
					The parent renderer superclass does nothing.  Only the mirror renderer will deal with this
					request for now.
				</p>
				<img src="images/557.jpg">
				<p>
					Here is the code for our mirror cell renderer.  We're not done here yet.
				</p>
				<img src="images/558.jpg">
				<p>
					The temporary variable "regionClass" is defined but currently unused.
				</p>
				<p>
					We're now at the point where we know which click-region is involved.
					A mouse-up event in the outer region would produce a rotate action.
					A mouse-up event in the inner region would produce a push action.
					Also, the MirrorCellRenderer knows about the cell object.  The click-region classes
					do not.  If we want to maintain polymorphism and delegate our click logic "down"
					we will have to give the cell object information to the click-region in the message we
					generate.
				</p>
				<p>
					We begin implementing the handling of the event in the
					CellClickRegion.  Note this is a <i>class</i> method.
					This guy will do nothing.  All the work will happen in the subclasses.
				</p>
				<img src="images/559.jpg">
				<p>
					Here is the code for the handling within the outside click region.
					Note the method #mouseUpForCell: still needs to be written.
				</p>
				<img src="images/560.jpg">
				<p>
					The method #mouseUpForCell: has not been written yet.
				</p>
				<p>
					The inside region.  We'll leave off the sending of the #mouseUpForCell:
					message here since we're not ready to deal with cell push just yet.
