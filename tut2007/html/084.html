			Our next problem to solve is knowing which arrow to use.  We've
			already worked out the code to detect when we are over a Mirror Cell
			and when we are in the "inside" or "outside" click region.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have a game design decision to make.  For the two click-regions
			within a cell, which one will we use for moving and which one for
			rotation?
			I'm leaning toward the idea that when the user clicks in the outer region
			the user is attempting to rotate the cell.  When clicking closer inside, towards
			the center of the cell, the user is attempting to push the cell.
			So there we have it.  A click within the inside click-region will attempt
			to push the cell.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's our magnified click regions again with an example arrow if
			the user has hovered over that region of the cell on the "left side" of the bar".

			What happens when the cursor is moved up and still within the inner click region?
		</p>

		<p>
			We obviously need a way to detect when the user is over the correct portion
			of the inner click region.
			It doesn't matter which way the mirror leans.  In this example the arrow should
			still point "south".
		</p>

		<p>
			The inner click region needs to be futher subdivided into 4 triangles.  One
			for each arrow or push direction.
