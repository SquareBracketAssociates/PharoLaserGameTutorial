			We need to initialize the new activeSegments variable.
			Add a protocol "initialize-release" and add a new instance
			method #initializeActiveSegments.  The default condition
			for these should all be
			false.
		</p>

		<p>
			The #initializeActiveSegments needs to be activated appropriately.
			One common convention is to use lazy-initialization -- call the
			method when the variable is discovered to be nil.  A technique
			I'd like to use is attach it to the automatic initialize process
			that happens whenever the object is instantiated.  Write a new
			#initialize method as follows.
		</p>
		<img src="images/050.jpg">
		<p>
			Note that the first thing we do in our #initialize method is
			call "super initialize".  This is a good practice to remember.
			Since we are implementing an #initialize method on our new class
			it is conceivable that we are overridding an important initialize operation
			somewhere in our superclass hierarchy.  By calling "super initialize"
			we give the superclasses in our hierarchy the opportunity to complete their initialization steps
			first.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before we get too far away from our original intention,
			we should write the two methods we intend to test.
			I created a new protocol for them called "testing".
			For the moment let them answer false.
			These are new instance methods for the BlankCell class.

		<b>Clarification.</b>
		You may be wondering how to create the Up Arrow character shown in those two methods.  Use the "^" character.
		You will find this character on your keyboard as Shift-6.  The early dialects of Smalltalk used this up-arrow character
		and Squeak still renders the ^ as an up arrow character.
