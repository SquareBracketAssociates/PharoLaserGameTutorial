				<h3>Introduction</h3>
				<p>
					An activity I enjoy is writing simple games in Squeak.  I also
					enjoy sharing this powerful development environment with interested
					developers.
					This is one of the reasons I write these tutorials.
				</p>
				<p>
					For this development
					example I'd like to try something different and take the student through the
					process of writing a game in Squeak.
					Proceed linearly through the example.
					The development process described here will be very specific
					to the way I work.  Consequently, you will see how
					I encourage organization of files and other processes
					as part of Squeak development.  In a very real way,
					Smalltalk development is a personal expression.
				</p>
				<p>
					Let's assume
					the student has downloaded Squeak and has some understanding
					of the Smalltalk programming language.
				</p>
				<p>
					This work make seem tedious at some points.  Every step of the process
					is described in detail.  Even when I made mistakes.  The idea here is to
					show how natural it is to iterate over design and implementation
					and the confidence that builds with test driven development.
				</p>
				<p>
					Frequently the pages of the tutorial will be filled with screen-shots of
					browser windows.  Although this may tend to be distracting for some readers,
					whenever I'm introducing something for the first few times the class hierarchy
					browser is shown so that the student can examine carefully and compare it to what
					they are doing in case there are mistakes.  After progressing through a lot more
					of the tutorial it's assumed this convention is no longer necessary and descriptions
					with code samples are given instead.
				</p>
				<p>
					The tutorial begins with a fresh download of Squeak 3.9.  I'm doing
					this development on a Macintosh running OS X.  With the exception
					of the host Operating System look-and-feel, and a few different install files,
					there should be no difference for a student working with other
					supported Squeak systems.  Here's my Squeak development
					folder's contents at the beginning of this tutorial.

					The "html" folder is where I develop the html pages
					for this tutorial.  It can be ignored.
