					Handling the mouse-up event in our rotate click-regions is easy since we
					already wrote the code on the mirror cells.
					Here's our clockwise handler.
				</p>

				<p>
					Counter-clockwise is equally simple.
				</p>
				<img src="images/563.jpg">
				<p>
					To complete the work we need to go back to the MirrorCellRenderer and send the
					messages to process the mouse-up event and redraw the cell.
				</p>

				<p>
					The last step is to go back to the LaserGame morph and complete the sequence where
					we began our journey.

					We need to add a special accessor method to the CellRenderer class.  This instance method should be
					added.
				</p>
				<p class="code">
					<b>cell</b><br>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^self grid at: self cellLocation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Open up your LaserGame morph if it's not already open and try clicking in the
					rotate regions of mirror cells.  It works.
				</p>
				<p>
					This is a good place to save your image and take a break.  We have a lot
					of good things happening in our little game.  You may have noticed while
					playing with your LaserGame morph that there's some clean-up issues we'll
					have to deal with.  The hint arrows aren't getting cleaned up very well and
					we see them hanging around after the cursor leaves the cell.  Also,
					if you tried firing the laser and moving mirrors around you probably noticed
					that we have additional work to do regarding what happens to the laser and
					cell states when a mirror moves.
				</p>
				<p>
					Still, this looks like a fun little game is starting to develop.
