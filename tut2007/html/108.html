			We should also enhance the grid test where we fire the laser
			and confirm that everything works as expected if we rotate
			a cell.
			Here's our test grid and the #testFireLaser we have so far.
		</p>

		<p>
			We will make a new test method that rotates
			a mirror cell which is on the path of the laser.
			That should make the target inactive when
			we fire the laser.
			Here's the test.
		</p>
		<img src="images/521.jpg">
		<p>
			However, something isn't working right.  We have a unit test problem and
			it's with our new test.
			Pop open the debugger and look around.
		</p>
		<img src="images/522.jpg">
		<p>
			Our target cell is still on yet we stopped firing the laser.
			And when we inspect the starting cell it's still turned on too.
			This sounds like an issue unrelated to rotating our mirror since the
			starting cell should have been off regardless.
		</p>
		<img src="images/523.jpg">
		<p>
			This failure report makes me now wonder why the toggle laser test works.
			Let's go back and enhance that test to see if there's a similar problem.
		</p>
		<img src="images/524.jpg">
		<p>
			When the unit tests are re-run there is only the failure in the mirror
			rotation related test we just wrote.  The toggle fired laser test passes.
			We need to do more digging.
		</p>
		<p>
			I added more testing within the mirror rotated laser test and it still fails.
			For some reason the target cell remains "lit" even when the mirror is turned.
		</p>
		<img src="images/525.jpg">
		<p>
			Within the debugger I restarted the method and single-stepped until I got to the
			step where the laser is about to be fired again - after the mirror was rotated.
		</p>
		<img src="images/526.jpg">
		<p>
			Step "Into" the #fireLaser message.  Step into the #activateCellsInPath when you
			get to it.  Step into the #calculatePath method when you get to it too.
		</p>
		<img src="images/527.jpg">
		<img src="images/528.jpg">
		<p>
			As we start stepping through the laser path calculation we can see there's
			an opportunity to make debugging information a little more visible for the cells.
			For example I have the "cell" temporary variable selected and in the bottom right corner
			text pane it reports that it's a mirror cell.  We can do a few simple things to
			make this easier.
		</p>
		<img src="images/529.jpg">
		<p>
			Leave the debugger open just where it is in execution and open up a class hierarchy browser
			(System Browser) on the Cell class.  We're going to enhance the printing output that is
			shown in debuggers and inspectors when one of these cell objects is selected.
		</p>
		<img src="images/530.jpg">
		<p>
			First we will add a protocol named "printing" and then create this method:
		</p>
		<img src="images/531.jpg">
		<p>
			Now when we click on a cell object in the debugger we see a little more helpful
			information than before.
		</p>
		<img src="images/532.jpg">
		<p>
			The cell at 1@5 is our starting cell and it's still reporting off even though we
			are firing the laser because we haven't calculated the laser's path to active cells yet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's do something similar to LaserPathElement.
		</p>
		<img src="images/533.jpg">
		<p>
			Now as we continue to step through with the debugger we can see
			meaningful information about the laser path element objects too.
