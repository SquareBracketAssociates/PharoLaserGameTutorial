		<h3>Grid Unit Test Activated</h3>
		<img src="images/021.jpg">
		<p>
			Let's go back to our enhanced Grid Unit Test
			and add some code that exercises all this stuff.
			We can activate the cells in the laser beam path
			and then check if the target cell is on.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's run our tests and see what happens.
		</p>

		<p>
			No joy.  There's an error.  Looks like
			the problem is that the cell has a nil gridLocation.
			If you inspect the cell you will see it is
			a Blank Cell.  I wonder if we forgot to
			ensure that the blank cells have their locations
			set when the initial grid is created?  Here's the #initializeCells
			method on our Grid class.
		</p>
		<img src="images/163.jpg">
		<p>
			Sure enough, the code that initializes the grid with
			blank cells does not use the method we wrote to
			add cells.  It accesses the cells dictionary
			directly through the accessor.
			Here's the method we should have been using.
		</p>

		<p>
			Fix the initialization method.
		</p>

		<p>
			Close the debugger if it's still open.  Let's rerun our unit tests.
		</p>
		<img src="images/166.jpg">
		<p>
			Something is wrong.  The tests never finish running.
			Type a Command-. (Command Period) to interrupt
			Squeak and see where we are hung up.
