		<h3>Drawing Push Hints On The Game Board</h3>
		<p>
			We want to draw our arrows onto the game board
			when the pointer is at specific places.
			We now have code that properly detects those conditions
			and which push direction to display.  We have a
			way to obtain the correct arrow form from our forms cache.
		</p>
		<p>
			A couple of design considerations include:
			<ol>
				<li>The arrow forms are not to-scale for our board</li>
				<li>We need to know exactly where to draw the arrow forms</li>
				<li>The arrow hint should be drawn over the correct cell</li>
				<li>We need to ensure that "old" arrows don't clutter the game board</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's go after the arrow forms scale problem first.
			Open up a workspace and execute this code.
			We get a nice little arrow that looks like it's the correct
			size.
		</p>

		<p>
			The #scaledToSize: method handles creating the smaller version
			of our arrow form.  We told it to create the smaller arrow
			at the same size as the cells themselves.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's confirm this works okay with one of the other arrows.

			I didn't tell Squeak to perform a "restore display" before drawing
			the second arrow.  It attempted to paint directly over the previous one
			and we see the picture does not look like we expected.
			That's a tip-off that we will need to ensure the cell is redrawn before we
			add our hint when it changes.
