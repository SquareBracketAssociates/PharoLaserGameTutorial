			The next change we need to make is to have the cell rotate messages include the grid.
			Let's take a look at the mouse-up code, where it all begins, in the LaserGame morph.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			<b>mouseUp: evt forMorph: aSketchMorph cell: aCell</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| renderer pixelPositionWithinBoard |<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;renderer := CellRenderer rendererFor: aCell grid: self grid form: self boardForm.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pixelPositionWithinBoard := self boardRelativePositionFor: evt.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;renderer mouseUpWithinBoardOffset: pixelPositionWithinBoard.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self changed
		</p>
		<p>
			The LaserGame object has an instance variable for the grid so we could modify the
			#mouseUpWithinBoardOffset: to include an additional argument of the grid.  Before we do
			that we should look at the CellRenderer class.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			Object subclass: #CellRenderer<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instanceVariableNames: 'cellLocation grid targetForm'<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;classVariableNames: ''<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poolDictionaries: ''<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;category: 'Laser-Game-Graphics'
		</p>
		<p>
			The renderers also know about the grid.  So we don't need to include it as an argument
			to our #mouseUpWithinBoardOffset: message after all.  Have a look at the
			#mouseUpWithinBoardOffset: instance method on the MirrorCellRenderer class.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			<b>mouseUpWithinBoardOffset: aPoint</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| cellPosn offsetWithinCell regionClass |<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cellPosn := self offsetWithinGridForm.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offsetWithinCell := aPoint - cellPosn.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regionClass := CellClickRegion clickRegionForPoint: offsetWithinCell. <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regionClass mouseUpWithinCellAtPoint: offsetWithinCell cell: self cell.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self redrawCell
		</p>
		<p>
			The region class hierarchy doesn't contain any information about grids.  So here's where
			we would begin to pass along the grid as an argument in our method calls.
			The #mouseUpWithinCellAtPoint:cell: method will have to change.  There are 3
			implementers of this method.  Each will have to be replaced with a new method.
		</p>
		<img src="images/597.jpg">
		<p>
			Let's create these 3 new methods right away and then change the renderer code to use them
			instead.  After that we'll delete the old unused methods.
			Here's the new class method on the CellClickRegion class.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			<b>mouseUpWithinCellAtPoint: aPoint cell: aCell withinGrid: aGrid</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's the new class method for the CellClickRegionInside class.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			<b>mouseUpWithinCellAtPoint: aPoint cell: aCell withinGrid: aGrid</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| pushRegion |<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pushRegion := self pushRegionForPoint: aPoint.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that we're not going to do anything with the inside click region and this new parameter
			just yet.  Most importantly, here's the new class method for our CellClickRegionOutside class.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			<b>mouseUpWithinCellAtPoint: aPoint cell: aCell withinGrid: aGrid</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| rotateRegion |<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rotateRegion := self rotateRegionForPoint: aPoint.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rotateRegion mouseUpForCell: aCell
		</p>
		<p>
			Now we use this new method back on the MirrorCellRenderer class.  Here's the modification
			to our existing instance method.
		</p>
		<p class="code">
			<b>mouseUpWithinBoardOffset: aPoint</b><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;| cellPosn offsetWithinCell regionClass |<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cellPosn := self offsetWithinGridForm.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offsetWithinCell := aPoint - cellPosn.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regionClass := CellClickRegion clickRegionForPoint: offsetWithinCell. <br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regionClass mouseUpWithinCellAtPoint: offsetWithinCell cell: self cell withinGrid: self grid.<br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self redrawCell
		</p>
		<p>
			After we have made this change we can go back and look for senders of the old
			#mouseUpWithinCellAtPoint:cell: method.  There shouldn't be any.  When you've confirmed
			that, you can then delete the 3 old implementers.
		</p>
		<p>
			We're now ready to push the grid argument further until we get to the code that actually
			does the rotation.  Here's the code for the CellClickRegionOutside where we need to do our next
			work.
		</p>
		<img src="images/598.jpg">
		<p>
			The #mouseUpForCell: methods are the next to be changed.  You can see this is
			where the work
			needs to happen.
		</p>
		<img src="images/599.jpg">
		<p>
			Here are the 2 new class methods.
		</p>
		<img src="images/600.jpg"><br>
		<img src="images/601.jpg">
		<p>
			Go back and call these new methods...
		</p>
		<img src="images/602.jpg">
		<p>
			Then, after confirming there are no longer any senders of the old #mouseUpForCell: methods, delete them.
			There's one last change.  Since we're not impacting other cells on the board we need to redraw
			whenever someone changes a cell now.  Here's the modified method.
		</p>
		<img src="images/603.jpg">
		<p>
			Open up a LaserGame morph and try it out.  You can rotate a cell while the laser is active
			and it works as we expect.  For fun, don't forget to try and rotate the cells on the
			bottom row and watch the target cell state change.
			We'll want to deal with the idea of prohibiting cell changes while the laser beam is
			active later on in our development work.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is another good breaking point to save your image.
