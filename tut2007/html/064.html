		<h3>Progress So Far</h3>

			Here's an interesting thought for our game development.
			It might be fun to show the path of the laser beam
			when it's activated, and we still need to write that code,
			but it's an interesting mental exercise if, for now,
			the game only showed the resulting target cell becoming
			On or Off depending on how the mirrors were placed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let's explore some other features we will need for
			our game as we get closer to make our first operational
			LaserGame morph.  It's also a good time to do some
			Squeak image management and code tweaks.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first thing I'd like to do is recategorize some of
			the classes.  The cell rendering class hierarchy
			is very specific to the graphics.  They should be
			moved to that system category.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's actually easy to do.  Select each class and then
			in the class definition pane, change the category.
		</p>

		<p>
			You can see which classes were moved to the graphics category.
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, if you haven't done so yet, now would be a good time
			to save your Squeak image.  Call up "save" from the World Menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			Part of the process of saving the image will cause the drawn
			form to become erased.  But that's okay.  You can always
			redraw it by running the workspace code again.
