					All of these instance methods belong on the
					LaserGame class.
					We will need a constant that defines the width
					of the control panel.  I'd like to place the
					game board on the left side of the morph and have
					a vertical control panel on the right.
					We will also need to calculate the size of our
					morph, so that we don't get that tiny little
					rectangle we saw before.  The #setExtent: method
					will be used to set our morph size during initialization.

					Here is the new #initialize method.  It references
					a morph setup method we haven't written yet.

					Setting up the morphs is simple if we think of having
					2 vertical panes, with the control panel on the
					right and having a fixed width.
					Again, we reference 2 other methods still not written.

					Here are the 2 methods that create the control panel and
					board morph.  Note that the control panel is just a
					blank white rectangle and the board is a SketchMorph
					based on the game form.

					If we open the LaserMorph now it should look
					a little more like we expect.

					It may not be easy to tell, but there's a white panel on the right
					side of the morph.
