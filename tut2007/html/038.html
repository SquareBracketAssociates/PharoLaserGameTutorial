				<h3>Direction Vectors</h3>
				<p>
					We've been using two kinds of systems to describe
					cell locations and laser beam direction.  In one situation
					we use x@y (column x, row y) objects to describe where cells
					are located within the grid.  We describe laser beam direction
					with the symbols #north, #east, #south and #west.
					A system needs to be constructed to allow us to
					combine these concepts when we start to navigate
					our laser beam across the grid and through cells.
					A clean class hierarchy of direction classes can
					handle the details nicely for us.  Add the following classes,
					shown here in the correct hierarchy.  Note that they are added on
					the Laser-Game-Model system category.
				</p>

				<p>
					That browser view may be a bit confusing.  What I'm doing is showing you
					the end result.  Let's approach this carefully, showing exactly how to
					create these classes and then how to view them in a hierarchy as shown.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first class we need to create will be the common class we will call
					GridDirection.  From the World Menu, choose "open...", and then "class browser".
					The standard Squeak class browser is presented.  Scroll down the
					System Categories list and select the system category
					"Laser-Game-Model", which we have of course already created.
				</p>
				<img src="images/798.jpg">
				<p>
					Create the new class GridDirection as a subclass of Object.
				</p>
				<img src="images/799.jpg">
				<p>
					We now want to create our 4 sublclasses for grid direction.  Here is the 
					class definition for the 1st one, GridDirectionEast.
				</p>
				<img src="images/800.jpg">
				<p>
					Note that GridDirectionEast is a subclass of our new class GridDirection.
					Continue on and create the other three subclasses GridDirectionNorth,
					GridDirectionSouth and GridDirectionWest.
				</p>
				<img src="images/801.jpg">
				<p>
					After having created these 4 subclasses of our new GridDirection class,
					let's change to a hierarchy view to inspect our results.  Here's how you
					do that.  First, select the GridDirection class.
				</p>
				<img src="images/802.jpg">
				<p>
					Now click on the "hierarchy" button.
				</p>
				<img src="images/803.jpg">
				<p>
					Squeak will open up a hierarchy browser on the class selected
					(GridDirection) and show all the subclasses in a nested list.
					You may have to resize your window to see the whole list.
				</p>
				<img src="images/804.jpg">
				<p>
					Now that we have our new directions hierarchy, lets resume and add some
					methods to create behaviors.  Note you can continue to write code for these classes
					using this hierarchy view browser if you want.
