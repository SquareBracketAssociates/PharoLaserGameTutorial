		<h3>Handle Mouse Events</h3>
		<p>
			To send mouse clicks to the cells we will need to
			intercept certain mouse actions in our LaserGame morph
			while the cursor is over the game board.  We can register
			several interesting events for our game board SketchMorph
			and handle them within our LaserGame morph.
			We can intercept and process:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>mouse down</li>
			<li>mouse up</li>
			<li>mouse enter</li>
			<li>mouse leave</li>
			<li>mouse move while button down</li>
			<li>mouse move while button up</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Modify the method we use to make the game board
			in our LaserGame morph so that we register an
			interest in some events.  We also
			give the morph a name we can use for later submorph
			searching.
		</p>

		<p>
			We have to write all of those receiver methods too.
		</p>

		<img src="images/357.jpg">
		<p>
			Note that we register an interest with the hand morph that we
			want to receive events from it while it is over the board.
			We also want to tell it when we are done listening.
		</p>
		<img src="images/358.jpg">
		<p>
			The mouse down events are different.  Ordinarily we
			only receive mouse move events when the mouse button is down.
			Hence, the funny name for our method.
		</p>
		<img src="images/359.jpg">
		<p>
			By registering with the hand morph when it came over on top
			of our board morph, we will now be receiving messages from it
			too.  We need to write support for that.
		</p>
		<img src="images/360.jpg">
		<p>
			This one is a little trickier since we will have to figure out if it's really
			over our board morph and then resend the event to the board morph.
		</p>
		<img src="images/361.jpg">
		<p>
			This method is the most interesting for us to watch, once we have it working
			properly.  For now we will write out which cell we find to the Transcript window.
			Don't try to do this with the new LaserGame morph just yet.  Just fill-in
			the code pieces as we go.  When we have enough in place we can try this one out.
		</p>
		<p>
			There some pieces we still need.
		</p>
		<img src="images/362.jpg">
		<img src="images/363.jpg">
		<img src="images/364.jpg">
		<p>
			Open up a Transcript window and a new LaserGame morph to try this out.  When you move the mouse
			over the game board, the Transcript should report which cell you are over.
		</p>
		<img src="images/365.jpg">
		<p>
			Once you have verified this is working as expected, remove the Transcript code and save your
			image.  This is a good breaking point.
