		<h3>Adding Controls</h3>
		<p>
			We will now add some controls to the control panel
			portion of our LaserGame morph.
			The easiest thing to do  is to add
			some simple buttons.
		</p>
		<p>
			For certain we should have a button to Quit the game.
			The Quit button can close the morph.
		</p>
		<p>
			Adding a button to Fire the laser would be good too.
			Although how we want that one to behave hasn't really
			been thought about yet.  We know we want to tell the
			grid the laser beam is active, but maybe this would be
			a temporary condition.  Maybe the laser beam only stays
			on for a short time.  Or maybe only while the button is
			down.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can begin by writing code to create a labeled text button.

			It's simple to create specific buttons now.

			We can "stub out" the action and state related methods for now.

			Here's our modified method for constructing
			the control panel.

			Open up a new LaserGame morph to see how it looks with our
			new buttons.
