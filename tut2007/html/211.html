			Afterwards,
			save your development image before we execute anything else.
			I prefer to leave the hierarchy browser open with the LaserGame class method
			#prepareApplication showing.

			So what will this do?
		</p>
		<p>
			The first thing that we will do is post the warning message about the following steps of
			execution.  Then assuming the developer wants to resume we ask a second question; asking
			if it's okay to close all open windows.
			This gives us two "outs" before we are committed to disabling features,
			launching our full-world laser game morph,
			registering the class for startup and saving a new
			second image for deployment.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now select the code "LaserGame prepareApplication" and execute.
			The first thing we should see is our little confirmation dialog
			warning us about the process we are about to perform.
		</p>
		<img src="images/773.jpg">
		<p>
			Click "Yes" and we will get the follow-on message about open windows.
		</p>
		<img src="images/774.jpg">
		<p>
			Once again click "Yes".
			Our Squeak environment should change to having the gradient blue background
			and our Laser Game should be visible.
		</p>
		<img src="images/775.jpg">
		<p>
			Before I typed in the name of the new deployment image, I noticed that
			there are some morphs left over from my development work.
			I want to close them before I continue.  Just command-click on these objects and
			then click on the "X" to delete each one.
		</p>
		<img src="images/776.jpg">
		<p>
			Once all morphs except for the Laser Game itself and the prompt image name dialog window
			are closed we can continue.
			Enter the name LaserGame in the dialog window.
		</p>

		<p>
			After Squeak writes out the new image, exit <i>without saving</i>
			from the existing image.
