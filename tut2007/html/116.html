		<h3>Clean Up Left-Over Hints</h3>
		<p>
			We have a problem to solve.  You've probably already noticed this if you've played
			at all with the LaserGame morph in its current implementation.
			There are "ghost" rotation arrows being left on cells.
		</p>
		<img src="images/566.jpg">
		<p>
			This is interesting because, at least in the playing around
			that I've done so far, the push hint arrows are never left behind.
			It seems to be only the rotation arrows.
			We have a subtle bug somewhere.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now I really do not know, as this is being written, what the real
			bug is.  I wonder if it's a transition detection problem when the
			cursor moves into the ignored region after having been inside the
			outer click region?  The arrow in the diagram below shows where I am
			thinking about.
		</p>
		<img src="images/567.jpg">
		<p>
			What's a good way to determine if this is the issue?  Here's the "show hint" code
			in the mirror cell renderer.
		</p>
		<img src="images/568.jpg">
		<p>
			What if the "arrowAndOffset" object is nil because we are in a region that needs no arrow, but
			we just left the outside click region?  Early in this method we perform a #redrawCell.
			That should cause the cell to be repainted without any arrows.  Then if we get a non-nill
			result for "arrowAndOffset" we draw the arrow.  If "arrowAndOffset" was nil we simply
			don't draw the arrow.  The cell should be without any arrows at this point then.
			So this doesn't seem to be the problem.
		</p>
		<p>
			We could enable some diagnostics again and see what events we get while moving the
			cursor rapidly between cells.  That will tell us a lot I'll bet.
		</p>
		<p>
			We should do a little bit of refactoring to make the diagnostics easier to write.
			There are 2 implementers of the #showPositionHintFromWithinBoardOffset: method.  One at
			the CellRenderer superclass where it currently does nothing and another (shown) on
			the MirrorCellRenderer.
		</p>
		<img src="images/569.jpg">
		<p>
			The temporary variable "cellPosn" is only used in the calculation for
			"offsetWithinCell".  This will prove to be useful in the superclass.  Let's extract
			that piece of code and put it on the superclass CellRenderer.
		</p>
		<img src="images/570.jpg">
		<p>
			We'll use that method in our #showPositionHintFromWithinBoardOffset: code in
			the mirror renderer.
		</p>
		<img src="images/571.jpg">
		<p>
			Here's the diagnostic code for the superclass.
		</p>
		<img src="images/572.jpg">
		<p>
			And now for the mirror renderer class.
		</p>
		<img src="images/573.jpg">
		<p>
			Open up a Transcript window and close and re-open the LaserGame morph so
			we get a "clean" one without any of those troubling ghost arrows.
			Now move the cursor between cells and stop when you see the bug.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's what I found.
		</p>
		<img src="images/574.jpg">
		<p>
			I started with the cursor over the target cell and then moved swiftly
			southwards.  Look at the Transcript diagnostics.  It begins at the
			target cell at location 5@1.
		</p>
		<!-- Thanks to Has van der Krieken for catching typo in next section.  -->
		<p>
			Then when we received an event for the cell below it at 5@2 the
			region reported was the ignore region.  That sounds correct.
			As the cursor went further downwards it transitioned to the
			outside click region for cell 5@2.
		</p>
		<p>
			However the next entry in the log is a surprise.
			It shows it went to cell 5@3 and on the inside click region.
			That means we "skipped" quite a few places.
		</p>
		<p>
			The event path expected, if we ignore repeats within the same cell,
			should have been something like this:
			<table>

			Examination of this sequence of events reveals something obvious
			we should have thought about before.  The operating system must "sample"
			mouse events at some given, and probably very fast, rate.  Squeak then
			must process the events it is given.  It's easy to believe that there is
			no "promise" that every intermediate event would be generated.
			We need to account for the fact that mouse move events can be pretty far apart
			when the cursor is traveling quickly.  As we see here, the cell regions can
			be skipped over.
