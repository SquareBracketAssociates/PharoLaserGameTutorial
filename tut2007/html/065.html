		<h3>Back to the LaserGame Morph</h3>
		<p>
			Right now if we open the LaserGame morph, we
			get a little colored rectangle on the screen.
			Try it.  From the World menu choose "new morph...".
			Select "from alphabetical list" and find
			our LaserGame in the menu.
		</p>

		<p class="note">
			If you didn't find LaserGame in the alphabetical morph
			menu list you may have not defined the class properly.
			Re-visit <a href="053.html">this work</a> if you did not find it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Command click on the morph to bring up the halos and then close it.
			Obviously we want to see our fancy grid instead.
			The morph will need a grid to work and for now let's
			continue to use our test grid from the grid factory.
			We should also add an instance variable for our form.
		</p>
		<img src="images/265.jpg">
		<p>
			Create the accessors for the new variable.
			The #initialize method is the next place to work.
		</p>

		<p>
			We can add the morphs we will need to make the game work.
			For now we know of only two.  The game board morph and the
			laser-fire button morph.
			I'm going to declare some methods in advance here since I think
			we will be adding more morph code very soon.
