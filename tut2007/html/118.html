	<h3>Bug With Target Cell</h3>
		<p>
			Our next bug to fix is where the target cell on our LaserGame morph
			remains "lit", if the laser is active <i>and</i> we rotate a
			mirror cell in such a way that the path of the laser beam can no
			longer reach the target cell.  Here's the situation.  I fired the laser,
			the target became lit and then rotated the mirror cell adjacent to the
			target cell, in the same row.  The target remains lit.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is obviously a bug.  There's also the issue of how we expect the
			user interface to handle cell push and rotation activity while the
			laser is active.  We never really stated any specific guidelines about
			this behavior when initially describing the game.  That is, there's no
			prior requirement that says a user should or should not be able to adjust
			cells while the laser is active.
		</p>
		<p>
			My own preference would be to inhibit the modification of cells on the grid
			while the laser is active.  That makes it too easy to solve.  And maybe we'll do
			that.  Maybe we'll add a provision to inhibit cell rotation or pushing in this
			situation.  But first we'll fix the bug that shows the target cell still being
			active when it clearly shouldn't be.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first question to ask ourselves is whether this is a bug in the model code or
			something unusual about the graphics code.  We may have already tested this specific
			behavior in a model unit test.  Here's our existing test case method.
		</p>

		<p>
			According to this unit test the target cell should not be active right now.
			Let's check some things out.  A simple check to see if it's a problem
			with the morph redrawing itself would be to temporarily cover it up.
			I created a Workspace window and placed it so the part of the board where
			we find the target cell is occluded.
		</p>
		<img src="images/584.jpg">
		<p>
			When we close the Workspace window the LaserGame morph will repaint.
		</p>
		<img src="images/582.jpg">
		<p>
			Nope.  Problem still there.  Let's inspect the morph itself.  Command-Click on
			the LaserGame morph.  The halos around it will appear.
		</p>
		<img src="images/585.jpg">
		<p>
			Click on the gray wrench halo and you will be presented with a Debug menu.
		</p>
		<img src="images/586.jpg">
		<p>
			Choose "explore morph" to open up an object explorer on our morph.
			Drag the object explorer window over to the side if it's covering
			our LaserGame morph.  I resized the window to make it wider too.
			If you click once on the arrow to the left of "root", the first layer
			of internals are revealed.
		</p>
		<img src="images/587.jpg">
		<p>
			Click on the arrow next to "grid" and then inside the grid on the arrow
			next to "cells".  You can see the objects that are in the grid cells dictionary.
		</p>
		<img src="images/588.jpg">
		<p>
			Look at that.  The target cell at location 5@1 is on!
			That shouldn't be.
