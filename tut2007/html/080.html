		<h3>Detecting Mirror Cell Click Regions</h3>
		<p>
			Back to work.
			Where we last left off we had just detected when a mouse was over
			cells on the game board.  Let's do some more work with the mouse-over
			code.

			That #showPositionHintFromWithinBoardOffset: hasn't been written yet.
			It would be useful for the user if we could draw a "hint" about what can
			happen when the user clicks over various positions.  The "hint" will
			eventually be visual.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that we're using polymorphism here.  The message will
			be sent to every cell renderer.  Individual renderers can decide what
			to do when they receive the message.  The Mirror Cells,
			the renderers actually, are the only ones we expect to care about
			this message for now.
		</p>
		<p>
			We should implement this on the CellRenderer superclass and then
			let any interested subclasses apply code as needed.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here's what the Mirror Cell Renderer will do with this message.

			For the moment, let's log on the Transcript two things
			each time we get one of these events/messages.
			Log the relative position within the cell itself and
			show which click-region claims the point.
			Make sure you have a Transcript window and our LaserGame morph open
			and try this out.  Hover the mouse around several cells and carefully
			move within the cell to see the regions respond.

			This looks promising.
