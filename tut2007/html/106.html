			Take a look at the #showPositionHintFromWithinBoardOffset: instance method in the
			MirrorCellRenderer class.

		<p>
			There are some opportunities to refactor and clean-up in here.
			The code that creates the temporary variable "pushRegionClass"
			is a little confusing since it's no longer just for "push" regions
			and now answers "rotate" regions too.  But that's just an issue with its name.
			After we create that variable we first check if it was nil and if it was not,
			we fetch the arrow.  Then right after we get the arrow we scale it and calculate
			and offset to locate the arrow properly within the cell.
		</p>
		<p>
			Another approach would be to get the arrow, already scaled, directly from the region class.
			And since the offset is likely to also be related to which arrow we get, we could also
			ask the region for the correct offset value too.
			The method #showPositionHintFromWithinCell: seems to be mis-named since that's
			not what it's doing.
		</p>
		<p>
			We could pass back both the scaled arrow form and the correct offset by putting
			them together in a simple object like an Association.  Let's try it.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we look for implementors of #showPositionHintFromWithinCell: we find it in three places.
			It's defined in the common superclass and again on each of the "inside" and "outside"
			click region classes.  All 3 implementors are class methods.
		</p>
		<img src="images/507.jpg">
		<p>
			We begin by writing a new method on the superclass.  It answers nil.
		</p>
		<img src="images/508.jpg">
		<p>
			For the inside click region we implement the method using pieces from the old
			hints code.  We will answer an Association where the key is the arrow offset and the
			value is the scaled arrow form.
		</p>
		<img src="images/509.jpg">
		<p>
			Here's the new similar implementation for the outside click region.
		</p>
		<img src="images/510.jpg">
		<p>
			We know we will come back and probably adjust the offset later.  Now we get
			to use our new method.
		</p>
		<img src="images/511.jpg">
		<p>
			Delete the old #showPositionHintFromWithinCell: class method from the 3 places where
			it's defined.  We no longer need this method.
			Now we go back and tweak the scale and offset for the rotation arrows.
		</p>
		<img src="images/512.jpg">
		<p>
			When you move the cursor around over the mirror cells the rotate arrows look
			better now.
