		<h3>Source Management With Monticello</h3>
		<p>
			We've been working on the Laser Game for quite a while.  We have 3 general
			system categories for our code.  One is for the model code, another for
			the graphics, and another for unit tests.
			I am certain you want to manage the source code that's been written
			so far in such a way that you know exactly what's included with your
			project and how to reproduce the code in a very deterministic manner.
			It's also important that you can version off a level of code that represents
			a "baseline" in case you want to try some experiments with what's working
			and need to be able to safely go back if you change your mind about
			changes.
		</p>
		<p>
			The most often used tool is called Monticello.  It's built right into Squeak 3.9 and
			provides a simple way to do all of those things.  You can save versions of your code in
			a repository of files.  Those files can be shared with other Squeak developers and users.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before we take the next steps, we will open up our class hierarchy browser again
			and review how we have the code organized.
		</p>
		<img src="images/642.jpg">
		<p>
			The three system categories we used to organize our code are "Laser-Game-Tests",
			"Laser-Game-Graphics" and "Laser-Game-Model".
			From the World menu, choose the "Open" menu and navigate to
			"Monticello Browser".
		</p>
		<img src="images/643.jpg">
		<p>
			The Monticello Browser opens up.
		</p>
		<img src="images/644.jpg">
		<p>
			We're only going to cover the basic most common uses for Monticello.  For our
			purposes everything will be managed by Monticello in a single "Package".
			We will call our package "Laser-Game".  This name is the beginning portion
			of the names of the three system categories we are already using.
			Click on the "+Package" to add the definition for our new package.
		</p>
		<img src="images/645.jpg">
		<p>
			Type "Laser-Game" for our new package name and click on "Accept".
		</p>
		<img src="images/646.jpg">
		<p>
			To examine the code that is included in the new package, click
			the "Browse" button.  After doing some source analysis, Monticello
			will open a snapshot browser of everything included in the package
			"Laser-Game".
		</p>
		<img src="images/647.jpg">
		<p>
			You can see our 3 system categories there and a new one
			named "*Extensions".
			Click on the "Laser-Game-Model" entry.
		</p>
		<img src="images/648.jpg">
		<p>
			You can browse the class definitions, and instance and class methods for
			the classes included in this system category for our package.
			What about the "*Extensions" entry?  Click on it next.
		</p>
		<img src="images/649.jpg">
		<p>
			Remember that instance method we added to the Object class?
			That's called an extension.  We didn't re-define the Object class.
			We merely added a method to it.  We extended it.  By using the
			protocol "*Laser-Game-Model" when we added it, it was automatically included by
			Monticello for our package.
