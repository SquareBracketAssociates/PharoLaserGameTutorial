			Do we have enough information to draw cell borders on our
			form now?
		</p>
		<p>
			Well there's still the trick of knowing where the cell is
			on the form itself.  Each cell knows its grid location
			but that needs to be translated into form-relative locations.
			The CellRenderer has enough information to work this out.  It has
			the cell (by way of lookup using the cell location), the
			grid and the form.  The renderer can calculate these offsets
			for us.
		</p>
		<p>
			We can develop how this will work from a unit test.

			For us to do this we'll need a form and a grid for our test.
			The GridTestCase has some nice code for creating
			a grid we can use in our tests.  However we should not
			mix up our unit test designs.  We could either cut-and-paste
			the code that created the test grid and put it into our
			test or maybe we could share that code.
			An easy way to do this would be to either put the
			test grid creation code into an abstract super class that the
			tests could be moved under as subclasses, or the code could
			be available somewhere else that both tests can reuse.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here's something to consider.  When our LaserGame morph first
			opens up for the user to play with it will need a grid layout.
			Sure we will want a randomizer and can use that whenever the
			game runs.  But what if we created a grid generator that could
			answer random populated grids
			<i>and a fixed populated grid we
				could use in our tests?
			</i>
