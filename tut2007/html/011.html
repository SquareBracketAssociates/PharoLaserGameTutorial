		<h3>Test Driven Development</h3>
		<p>
			As much as practical, we should use the SUnit unit testing framework to implement
			the game model. More than likely we'll not concern ourselves with writing unit tests
			for the actual behavior of the GUI. But there's plenty we can accomplish by driving
			our development of the game model from unit tests.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm not too attached to how we code the very first few lines of code. An approach I've
			seen used by many people is to begin with the Unit Tests, even to the point of not having
			any objects to test before the first test is written. Another approach is to implement
			some basic model and then drive from that point forward using Unit Tests.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unit Tests will help us accomplish several things.
			<ol>
				<li>Help us to develop our objects.</li>
				<li>Provide a consistency check as we continue to
					add code.  This helps us to keep from breaking
					things we've already written that work.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			I have found that good unit tests capture your requirements
			and help you as you implement design.  Often,
			when you write a unit test you are forced to think about your design
			as if it were finished.
		</p>
		<p>
			We'll have to do a little more definition in the Squeak development environment before
			we do anything else. So let's get that out of the way next.
			Relaunch the Squeak environment if you currently do not have it running. Be sure
			to choose your previously saved "Squeak.image" file.
